To build crono, run `ant` from the toplevel directory.

To run crono:
  cd bin
  java crono.Crono [<file>]

Type Inferencing will print out for each command executed. 

To show the process of unification use command (set infer_print true)
To cycle through the steps of unification use command (set infer_cycling true)
In order to turn those off substitute false for true on the same commands.

This will show each step of the unification process for all commands executed. If you are cycling it will print out what is on each stack for every cycle.

To exit the program use command (quit)

All source files are located in src/crono. All output files are put in bin/.
